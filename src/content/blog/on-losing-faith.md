It was the summer of 2018. I was still basking in the newfound glory of having become a mildly successful youtuber. The month of Ramzan was approaching. Having made a keen exploration of Sufism last Ramzan, I was on the lookout for another spiritual endeavour to dive into this year. Not the tedious practice of reading the Quran end-to-end, as my mother expected of me, but something actually useful.

I don't recall how I came upon it, but it was a question that started it all. Just one simple, harmless question became the seed to undoing years of indoctrination. It all began as "Why does God care?"

_Why does the creator of such an unfathomably vast cosmos needs me to perform a ritual that involves facing in the direction of a black room on the other side of the planet, making intricate body movements, and uttering some magical words in a language that I do not understand, five times, every day?_

_Since God is an infinitely higher being than us, what reason could he possibly have for asking these pointless gestures of us? I'm a (finitely) higher being than ants but would I ever want the ants to worship me? Would I appoint one of the ants as my prophet and then ask him to go tell the other ants to either submit to my will, or to prepare themselves for the wrath of my magnifying glass? Would I ask them to mutilate the peepees of little baby ants? Or to always wear their trousers above their ankles? Do ants even have ankles?_

Then came the moral questions. The Epicurean Paradox, for instance.

> Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
> <span>Epicurus (3rd Century BC)</span>

Here's an expanded version.

While all of these questions were raging in my mind, I felt a little scared. Scared because these thoughts had the potential to land me in hell. Anyhow, I felt I had a duty towards myself to discover the truth. "If there really is an intelligent God out there, would he want me to follow him just out of the fear of punishment? I think he'll understand", I rationalized to myself.

I suppose you can probably guess the conclusions that I reached by the title of this post. They went against everything that I had spent the first 19 years of my life believing to be true. The first few weeks were tough. "What if I'm wrong?". "What if he turns out to be real?". "What if I go to hell?". Then it got better. Better than it ever was, since being free of religion meant that I could now spend more of my time and energy to focus on the things in life that really mattered, instead of trying to please an imaginary, authoritarian father figure with outdated morals.

In the years that followed, I invested quite a bit of time learning about theistic and antitheistic arguments. I read and listened to thinkers like Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Stephen Fry and Lawrence Krauss. I lost some people I used to call friends, found some new ones, got threatened with abduction. In the end, I believe losing my faith was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It left me a better, wiser, and kinder human being.
