_The Sky Will Shift_

_but not as it did before._

_Not like the trees that bent to touch_

_the earth in aching deference, nor_

_the birds that traced invisible lines_

_upon the canvas of azure expanse._

_Life, a theater of perplexities–_

_don't dwell on the droll comedy_

_or the lead role you never chose._

_No, this is more than shifting skies,_

_it's the hum of endless quandaries_

_unresolved in the grand scale_

_of cosmic jests. You see,_

_a woman once whispered to me,_

_"Life's a tale told by an idiot,_

_yet the narrative remains."_

_How I laughed, disarmed by_

_her approximation of truth._

_To live is to drift through cycles,_

_unpredictable orbits. I will tell_

_you now, the sky will indeed shift_

_and we'll find ourselves spun anew._

_Not quite hopeful, yet not devoid–_

_you should see how I live in spite of it._
