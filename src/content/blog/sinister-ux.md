Sinister user experience (SUX - pun intended) is the deliberate and often deceptive degradation of user experience for the benefit of the entity offering the service. The term is similar to [dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) but broader in its coverage of unethical or deceptive practices.

A UX qualifies to be SUX when:

1. It has been intentionally degraded.
2. The deterioration is meant to directly or indirectly benefit the service provider.
3. Users have either not been made aware of the degradation or are misled about its real intent.

**Some examples**,

1. Amazon [trapped](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ftc-amazon-trapped-millions-into-hard-to-cancel-prime-memberships/) users by signing them up for Prime subscriptions without their knowledge and then making it difficult to cancel.
2. Apple was [found](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/936268845/apple-agrees-to-pay-113-million-to-settle-batterygate-case-over-iphone-slowdowns) to be secretly slowing down old iPhones and then lied about doing so.
3. HP has been [known](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers) for releasing "security" updates that render third-party ink cartridges unusable on its printers, forcing users to buy official, often more expensive, cartridges.
4. X [throttles](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/15/23875251/x-twitter-links-throttling-facebook-instagram-threads) links to competitor sites.
5. Many services deliberately introduce friction into their customer support UI flows to reduce operational costs, making it harder for users to reach out.
6. Sites like Facebook make it difficult for users to delete their accounts, trying to convince them to stay at each step of the process.
