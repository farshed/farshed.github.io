I recently had the chance to watch _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ (no I'm not joking) and _Perrito_'s character reminded me of a realization that I had about human behaviour not so while ago. This insight had to do with how one's internalized worldview shapes their personality. I worded it as "_We become as we perceive the world to be_" or more succinctly (and rather dramatically) as the title of this post.

What it means is that a person's character tends to be a reflection of their subconscious worldly outlook. People with a positive worldview tend to have generally more positive personality traits while those with a negative worldview tend to have more negative ones. This is in part due to how we judge others.

There is at least some [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_projection) to suggest that people are more likely to judge others to be similar to themselves. One reason for this may be that we often rely on our own experiences and perspectives to understand others. So, we are more likely to interpret the behaviors and intentions of others in a way that aligns with our own behaviors and intentions.

Moreover, how we judge others also influences our own behaviour. For example, imagine a person who expects others to be selfish. Would such a person be more likely to behave selfishly themselves in order to protect their own interests, or would they still be as generous as they might have been otherwise?

Based on the above premise, we can imagine two distinct personality archetypes, each of which lies on the opposite extremes of a spectrum. Almost everyone you know should fall somewhere between these two extremes.

## Positively Inclined Individual

On the very positive end of the spectrum lies the following set of traits.

- Optimistic.
- Easily trusting.
- Non-judgmental.
- Plays defense.
- Agreeable.
- High in conscientiousness.
- Quick to apologize.
- Poor with enforcing their personal boundaries.
- Potentially naive due to their trusting nature.

For brevity, I will henceforth refer to an inclination towards these traits as PI (short for positive inclination or positively inclined). People with a PI tend to have better conflict resolution, report higher life satisfaction, and tend to foster healthier interpersonal relationships. In essence, they are more likely to follow the social rules of good behaviour because they expect others to do the same.

## Negatively Inclined Individual

People with a negative inclination or NI lean towards the following traits.

- Pessimistic.
- Mistrusting.
- Judgemental.
- Plays offense.
- Disagreeable
- Low in conscientiousness.
- Quick to criticize.
- Poor at respecting the personal boundaries of others.
- Cynical of others due to their mistrusting nature.

People with a very high NI tend to exhibit what is referred to as a _high-conflict personality (HCP)_. They are characterized by their negative approach to conflict resolution, a tendency to externalize problems, and often unstable relationships. These individuals are also more likely to exhibit manipulative and abusive behavior because they expect others to behave in the same way.

## Takeaways

How can we leverage this insight to our advantage to build more fulfilling relationships? Well, the first thing to understand is that both extremes are harmful in their own ways. So it's recommended that one's internalized worldview avoids these extremes and instead lies somewhere between them, preferably with a leaning towards the positive end.

Secondly, since these behaviours are internalized, one has to actively work to notice the flaws in their existing worldview and must make a conscious effort to correct them until their internalized worldview improves. For those who think that they may be too close to the positive end, I recommend reading Dr. Cloud's [Boundaries](https://www.drcloud.com/books/boundaries) as a good starting point.

Thirdly, if you think that you might have a PI and are looking to get romantically serious, it would be advisable to seek out a partner with the same inclination as yours. Romantic NI-PI relationships don't tend to bode very well for the PI partner.

## Final Thoughts

A question arises here if you think about it a little more. Which came first â€” the person's inclination that shaped their worldview, or their worldview that shaped their inclination? I'm not sure but this has important implications for the nature vs. nurture debate and how it ties into free will. I believe I have a half-written post about that lying around somewhere, which I'll probably share soon.

As a final note, I want to emphasize that the aforementioned traits are merely behavioural generalizations based on common trends and should not be taken as universal truths. Also, this model is definitely flawed in many ways since human behaviour is far too complex to be encapsulated by a single unidimensional spectrum. Nevertheless, I have found it generally good enough to help me with my personal growth and to better navigate my social exchanges.
