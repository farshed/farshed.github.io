title: 'We Only Judge Ourselves'
description: 'How our internalized worldview reflects in our character and shapes the person we become.'

I recently had the chance to watch _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ (no I'm not joking) and the character of _Perrito_ reminded me of a realization that I had about human behaviour not so while ago. This insight had to do with how one's internalized worldview shapes their personality. I worded it as "_We become as we perceive the world to be_" or more succinctly (and rather dramatically) as the title of this blog post.

What it means is that a person's character tends to be a reflection of their subconscious worldly outlook. People with a positive worldview tend to have generally more positive personality traits while those with a negative worldview tend to have more negative ones. This is in part due to how we judge others. There is at least some [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_projection) to suggest that people tend to be more likely to judge others to be similar to themselves.

One reason for this may be that we often rely on our own experiences and perspectives to understand others. So, we're more likely to interpret the behaviors and intentions of others in a way that aligns with our own behaviors and intentions. Based on this information, we can imagine two distinct personality archetypes, each of which lies on the opposite extremes of a spectrum.

## Positively Inclined Individual

People on the very positive end of the spectrum usually tend to have the following set of traits.

- Optimistic.
- Easily trusting.
- Non-judgmental.
- Plays defense.
- Agreeable.
- High in conscientiousness.
- Quick to apologize.
- Poor with enforcing their personal boundaries.
- Potentially naive due to their trusting nature.

For brevity, I will henceforth refer to an inclination towards these traits as PI (short for positive inclination or positively inclined). People with a PI tend to have better conflict resolution, report higher life satisfaction, and tend to foster healthier interpersonal relationships.

## Negatively Inclined Individual

People with a negative inclination or NI tend to possess the following traits.

- Pessimistic.
- Mistrusting.
- Judgemental.
- Plays offense.
- Disagreeable
- Low in conscientiousness.
- Quick to criticize.
- Poor at respecting the personal boundaries of others.
- Cynical of others due to their mistrusting nature.

People with a very high NI will tend to have what is referred to as an HCP or a _high-conflict personality_. They are characterized by their negative conflict resolution, often unstable relationships, and are more likely to be manipulative and abusive because they expect others to be the same way. HCPs are estimated to constitute about 10-20% of the general population.

Almost everyone you know will fall somewhere between these two extremes.

## Takeaways

How can we leverage this insight to our advantage to build more fulfilling relationships? Well, the first thing to understand is that both extremes are harmful in their own ways. So it's recommended that one's internalized worldview avoids these extremes and instead lies somewhere between them, preferably with a leaning towards the positive end.

Secondly, these behaviours tend to be internalized. This means one has to actively work to notice the flaws in their existing worldview and must make a conscious effort to correct them until their internalized worldview improves. For those who think that they may be too close to the positive end, I recommend reading Dr. Cloud's [Boundaries](https://www.drcloud.com/books/boundaries) as a good starting point.

Thirdly, if you think you might have a PI and are looking to get romantically serious, it would be advisable to seek out a partner with a similar inclination as yours. NI-PI relationships don't tend to bode very well for the PI partner.

## Final Thoughts

A question arises here if you think about it a little more. Which came first; the person's inclination that shaped their worldview, or their worldview that shaped their inclination? I'm not sure but this has important implications for the nature vs. nurture debate and how it ties into free will. I believe I have a half-written post about that lying around somewhere, which I'll probably share soon.

As a final note, I want to emphasize that the aforementioned traits are merely behavioural generalizations based on common trends and should not be taken as universal truths. Also, this model for thinking about human behaviour probably has its flaws but I have found it generally good enough to help me work on my own issues and to better navigate my social interactions.
