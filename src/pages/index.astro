    Hi! I'm Faisal, a software engineer with a passion for building and tinkering with things. I'm
    currently working at <a href="https://smashcloud.com" target="_blank">SmashCloud</a>, where I
    craft tailored software solutions using React, Node.js and the cloud. Besides work, my current
    areas of active interest include compilers, data-oriented design, WASM and 2D graphics. I mostly
    work with JavaScript and Rust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apart from tech, I enjoy exploring music, science fiction, existentialist literature,
    psychology, and (epi)genetics. I have a <a href="/blog">blog</a> where I sometimes dump my thoughts
    and opinions about stuff that I find interesting. If you're a recruiter, you might be interested
    in my <a href="/faisal-arshed-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.
