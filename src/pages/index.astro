    Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Faisal, a software engineer and open sourceror with a passion for building and
    tinkering with things.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current areas of active interest include compilers, data-oriented design, WASM and 2D
    graphics. I mostly work with TypeScript and Rust.
  </p>
  <p>Besides tech, I find myself drawn to science, philosophy and culture.</p>
  <p>
    I have a <a href="/blog">blog</a>
     where I sometimes share my thoughts and opinions about stuff I find interesting.
